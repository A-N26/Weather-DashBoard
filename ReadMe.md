## Description

In this challenge, we are tasked with creating a weather dashboard using [openweathermap](#https://openweathermap.org/) site to pull weather info automatically generated by the OpenWeatherMap API for the user on requesting the info for any given city typed into the search input. We were provided with simply a mock-up of the look of the desired end-product.

## Additions

- HTML→
  - Added various comments/description (mostly for myself).
  - Added tab Icon from favicon site.
  - Added bootstrap css and js links.
  - Added fontawesome css link.
  - Added moment js link for the dates to desplay appropriately.
  - Added links to local css and js files.
  - Added variety of content in the body to make the look and feel of the html as close to as the mock-up as possible.
  - After adding some properties to local css realized html was not reflecting the file despite the proper link creation. Thus, added style in the html itself which was certainly being reflected properly. Came to know later on that bootstrap css would take full precedence over teh local css file. Still left the local css linked  and in assets as is.

- CSS→
  - Added very few properties but as nothing was reflecting in html from external styling means, stopped adding any more styles to the file. Instead, added all the styles to the html inline.

- Javascript→
  - Added moment js variables to dynamically display the dates per the day of the week. and appended them to function/update as intended.
  - Added variables for each part of the openweathermap url to try and make the coding a bit easier.
  - Added various functions and onclick functions for searching cities, getting weather info, etc.
  - Added a console.log to see if search button related function works.
  - Added comments appropriately.

## Challenges

    - While Initially local css not reflecting was a irritating. It was quickly recovered from and theng were fine untill the mighty dreadful javascript part came along...
    - No matter what i do i cant get teh 401 unauthorized error to stop popping up in console on clicking search after typing any city's name. Initially i thought i might have copied the app id values wrongly despite copy-pasting them. but no. Later on came across 2 threads (one in github and another on stackoverfow that suggested to do as advised in a thread in freecodecamp site). Per suggestion tried prepending "api." to all of the openweathermap urls in the script code but nothing changed. then i went for the second option and prepended the "https://api." with "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/" to all the openweathermap urls and stil the damned error wouldnt budge.
    - I Dont know What the issue is anymore...
